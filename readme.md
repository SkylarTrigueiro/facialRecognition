# Facial Recognition (Work in progress)

This project is about training a Siamese neural network to determine if two photos are of the same person.


## Data

The data used to train the model is the "Yale Face Databse" which can be found at http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database

This project started as a project in the Udemy course "Pytorch: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence", which I highly recommend.
